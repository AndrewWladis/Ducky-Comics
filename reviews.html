                <h5 class="card-title">Batman: White Knight Review</h5>
                <h5 class="card-title">By Duck</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Batman White Knight is a comic that twists my perspective. It's different, and I like it because of that. Batman White Knight is written and drawn by Sean Murphy. This looks at the classic Batman character line-up and slightly changes them to fit the story. Each change makes the character fit the story better and makes the character an overall better character. Duke Thomas in the normal Batman comics is just a new Robin, but in Batman White Knight he is a man who lives in the bad parts of Gotham and helps kids. This is also one of the only comics (besides Batman: The Killing Joke) to handle and reveal the Joker's identity in a good way. Joker is so well done in this comic. Jack Napier (Joker’s real name) actually regrets the things he did as Joker. Batman White Knight also has a lot of synergy. Batman and Batgirl’s relationship mirrors Joker and Harley’s relationship. Batman starts out as the good guy and Joker is the bad guy, but by the middle of the comic Batman is the bad guy and Joker is the good guy. Neo Joker and the Mad Hatter mirror Batgirl and Mister Freeze. One plot point that I thought was really well done was Alfred’s death. It was really sad. This is a great comic, good take on Joker, four and a half stars.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Batman Earth One Review</h5>
              <h5 class="card-title">By Duck</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Batman Earth One is one of the best Batman comics I’ve ever read. It is written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Gary Frank. It’s artwork is great and perfectly matches Batman and Gotham City. It creatively reimagined Batman and Gotham City. It’s story is very similar to the Dark Knight Trilogy. Although it’s story is similar to the movies, it’s dialogue, character development, and the story is different, but amazing. Batman Earth One nails Batman, Penguin, and Alfred. One thing it does really well is following Commissioner Gordon, Harvey Bullock, and the Gotham City Police Department. It has a completely new take on Harvey Bullock. He starts out as an inexperienced cop who was on a tv show. At the end he is the Harvey Bullock we know and love, a bad cop who has no hope in Gotham’s citizens and is scared from his past experiences. The Birthday Boy was Geoff Johns's try at making a Batman villain. Geoff Johns is a great writer, but the Birthday Boy was a failure. It was trying to be a great, strong, memorable villain like Bane, but the Birthday Boy was just too generic. It is just another strong villain working for a bigger and better villain. In this story the bigger and better villain is the Penguin. As you can see, Batman Earth One is a great comic that creativity reimagined Gotham City, it’s only problem is it's villain. Four and a half stars.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Superman Secret Origin Review</h5>
                <h5 class="card-title">By Duck</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">I recently read Superman: Secret Origin. It is amazing. It is written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Gary Frank; the same super star writers behind Batman Earth One; my favorite Batman comic. It perfectly represents what Superman represents; truth, justice, and the American way. In Superman: Secret Origin, Clark Kent (and Superman) are done so well. In Metropolis all he wants is to help people. I also love that his glasses can block his heat vision. Something else I love in it is the Legion of Superheroes in this. It is a great allusion to the early Superboy comics. Speaking of allusions Superman catching Lois when she is falling is probably a reference to the first Christopher Reeves Superman movie. Lex Luthor is also really well done. When we are introduced to Lex Luthor’s charity (where he picks one lucky person to get stuff) everyone wants to get picked, but at the end no one is there (because of Superman). There is a page where you see Lex Luthor at the stage while no one is at his charity. Words can not describe that page. This is why Geoff Johns and Gary Frank are my favorite comic creative team. Great art, even better writing and story, five stars. This review shout-out goes to @Lukemenacho6 on tik tok. @Lukemenacho6 is one of the biggest fans of ducky comics.
